While the Service Lifecycle Manager of SOCIETIES is an internal component not accessible to 3rd party services, it exposes an interface org.societies.api.services.IServices that provides some functionalities to 3rd party developers. Access to this component is obtained via normal Spring and OSGI methods. This API is still in development, with the current version offering these methods:</p>
<xmp>2     /**
 3      * This method allows a third-party service to get its own ServiceResourceIdentifier by passing a reference to itself.
 4      * Note that it only works after the service is fully started, so shouldn't be used in "init" methods of the bean.
 5      *
 6      * @param callingClass (i.e., "this")
 7      * @return the service resource identifier of the service
 8      */
 9     public ServiceResourceIdentifier getMyServiceId(java.lang.Class<?> callingClass);
10
11     /**
12      * This method allows a service to retrieve its own name
13      *
14      * @param serviceId
15      * @return the name of the service
16      */
17     public String getMyName(ServiceResourceIdentifier serviceId);

19     /**
20      * This method allows a service to retrieve its version
21      *
22      * @param serviceId
23      * @return the service version
24      */
25     public String getMyVersion(ServiceResourceIdentifier serviceId);
26
27     /**
28      * This method is used by a third-party client service to get the node of its parent/server
29      *
30      * @param serviceId
31      * @return the node of the parent
32      */
