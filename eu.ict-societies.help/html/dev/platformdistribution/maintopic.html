<h1>SOCIETIES Platform Distribution</h1>

The latest SOCIETIES Virgo releases can be downloaded from our downloads site (http://www.ict-societies.eu/open-source/downloads/). Each release includes a custom distribution of the Virgo application server and the SOCIETIES 'cloud' and 'domain authority' software bundles and configuration files. Android client application is also provided as of Release 1.0.
<br>This steup guide is based on the latest SOCIETIES platform release, version 1.0, where the default configuration is a multi-user container configuration of one combined node (Domain Authority + CSS User cloud) and one CSS user container.
<br>It is recommended that you read the Virgo user guide (http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.5.0.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/index.html) before installing the distribution. Also make sure to review other setup guides, such as Developer_Environment_and_Toolkit_Setup (https://redmine.ict-societies.eu/projects/sp/wiki/Developer_Environment_and_Toolkit_Setup) for installing a Java runtime.
