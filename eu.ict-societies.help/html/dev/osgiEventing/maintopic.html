<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The eventing and pubsub feature provided by the SOCIETIES Platform allows 3rd party service
developers to exploit those designs patterns within their services. There are currently 2 eventing models available.</p>
<br>1.	Internal eventing between bundles within the container using the OSGI EventAdmin. Events only available to bundles running within the same container. Supports native java objects as payloads
<br>2.	External eventing between conecting clients (including other containers). Allows a CSS Node to create an event stream for other clients (CSS nodes) to subscribe to. Supports schema generated objects only as payload.
<p>The Pubsub service is dependent on the communication framework. Please ensure you have deployed the Comms Frwk bundles first. See Using the Communication Framework
To follow along with the sample code shown below, see ExampleClientCommand project in the GIT/Platform-Infrastructure/Comms-frwk/ExampleServices/ folder
