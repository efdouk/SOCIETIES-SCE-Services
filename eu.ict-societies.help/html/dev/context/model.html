<h1>Model</h1>

The context model will be used in order to represent all the necessary information that describes the situation of a CSS entity or a group of entities that form a CIS. In more detail, the model consists of the following main classes:
<ul>
<li>CtxModelObject</li>
</ul>

It is the base abstract class of all context model objects. It is extended by the following classes:
<ul>
<li>CtxEntity</li>
</ul>

The CtxEntity class represents the notion of a context entity which corresponds to an object of the physical or conceptual world. The type of a CtxEntity defines the nature of the modelled entity.  For example an entity could be a "person", a "device", or a "service".
<ul>
<li>CtxAttribute</li>
</ul>

The CtxAttribute class describes a CtxEntity's static and dynamic properties such as the "name", "age", or "location". Multiple CtxAttributes can be assigned to a CtxEntity,while the value of each CtxAttribute can be set and retrieved using the appropriate setter and getter method. The following CtxAttributeValueTypes are supported:

<ul>
<li>INTEGER: Integer value.</li>
<li>STRING: Text value.</li>
<li>DOUBLE: Double-precision floating point numeric value.</li>
<li>BINARY: Binary value (<i>byte[]</i>).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>CtxAssociation</li>
</ul>

The CtxAssociation is used in order to describe relations among different CtxEntities. We define two types of associations ; Undirected associations that are peer relations (e.g. "friends", "schoolmates", "fellowPassengers") and directed associations that are non-peer relations ("locatedIn", "owns", "uses").

<ul>
<li>CommunityMemberContextEntity</li>
</ul>

It is a subclass of the CtxEntity class and a generalisation of the two classes below.

<ul>
<li>IndividualContextEntity</li>
</ul>

It is used in order to represent individuals (CSS owners). More specifically, an IndividualCtxEntity may belong to zero or more CISs, simultaneously. The individual members of a pervasive community do not need to be human beings (i.e. of type "person"). They can also be organisations, smart space infrastructures, autonomous or semi-autonomous agents, etc. It inherits all attributes and operations of the CtxEntity class and extends them by methods related to the management of communities the individual belongs to.

<ul>
<li>CommunityContextEntity</li>
</ul>

This class is used to represent community context entities. A CommunityCtxEntity corresponds to a pervasive community (CIS) and is associated with a set of  CommunityMemberCtxEntity objects representing its members, i.e. individuals and/or other communities. The CtxAttribute class is used in order to describe the community context attributes of a CIS. Common context characteristics shared among community members are described by the CtxBond class.

<ul>
<li>CtxAttributeBond</li>
</ul>
<p>This class is used to represent context bonds among members of a CommunityCtxEntity. Each bond refers to a CtxAttribute of a particular type that expresses a commonality shared by community members. For example, a CtxAttributeBond could be based on the context
attribute of type LOCATION_SYMBOLIC. The CtxBondOriginType is used to specify how the bond was identified. More specifically, a context bond may have been manually set, discovered or inherited.
