<h1>Build and deploy your bundle</h1>
<p>While it is possible to deploy a service in SOCIETIES by simply deploying the bundle in the OSGI container, this will miss out on most of the Service Lifecycle Manager capabilities. As such, services should be deployed from the SOCIETIES web-app.
<br>-Server and Web type of services should be installed by going to the My Apps page, selecting the bundle to upload to the container and pressing the Install button.
<br>-Client services should NOT be installed with this process. They should only be installed by sharing them to a CIS and installing it from the CIS shared services page.
