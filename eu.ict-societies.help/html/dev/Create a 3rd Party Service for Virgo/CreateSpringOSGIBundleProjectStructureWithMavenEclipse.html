<h1>Create your Spring OSGi bundle project structure using Maven and Eclipse</h1>
<p>This section uses an example 3rd party service project which is available on github (https://github.com/societies/SOCIETIES-SCE-Services/tree/Development/3rdPartyServices/ExampleService).</p>
<p>In order to build your 3rd party service as a Spring OSGi bundle, you will need to create a required project structure. The key parts of your project are as follows:</p>
<br>Java source folder
<br>	Resources folder for Spring XML configuration files
<br>	For declaring your Spring beans or Java implementation classes: bundle-context.xml
<br>	For declaring your Spring OSGi services to be deployed and the references of other services your require: bundle-context-osgi.xml
<br>	Maven POM configuration file for building your Spring OSGi bundle jar
