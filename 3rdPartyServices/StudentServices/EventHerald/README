Eventherald.
--------------------

Eventherald is a service comprising of three individual pieces that need to be build and installed seperately.

a. The Eventherald Android client (Cordova based)
b. The Status.net server (Apache based)
c. Eventherald backend service. (Virgo based)


This folder contains the subcomponents that make up Eventherald.


Installation
----------------------

More detailed instructions for installing them follow.  What follows is the quick start guide.


A. Building and installing the client.
--------------------

1. Install Ant.

2. Modify the "local.properties" build file in the root directory to point to your Android SDK. 
a. Open "local.properties" and modify the following line appropriately.

sdk.dir=/work/tools/android-sdk-linux

3. Move to root directory.

cd <eh_cordova>

4. Build with the appropriate command.

a.For a debug version

ant clean debug  

b. Or for a release version

ant clean release

5. Install the service on the phone. (Whatever way you want)



B: Installing the statusnet server.
--------------------

1. Install Apache2

2. Install Status.net. (Henceforth the root directory is called SN_ROOT)

3. Configure status.net with the database settings, and local setup.  This will require your mysql DB admin password.


4. Install the Annotations plugin. (This is a modified version from TSSG)
a. Source can be found in "statusnet-annotations-plugin" and copy to SN_ROOT/plugins

cp -r statusnet-annotations-plugin/Annotations SN_ROOT/plugins

b. Modify SN_ROOT/config.php to activate the annotations plugin. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

addPlugin('Annotations', array(
  'demo' => true,
  'stored_annotations' => array(array(
     'custom_tssg_event' => array(
       'event_title' => null,
       'event_start_time' => null,
       'event_end_time' => null,
       'event_date' => null,
       'event_location' => null,
       'event_url' => null,
       'event_description' => null,
       'event_lat' => null,
       'event_long' => null)))));


5. Verification - Log into status.net to verify apache and statusnet setup.

6. Create an account for "eventherald"


C: Installing the eventherald backend.
--------------------

1. Install Virgo 3.6 container.  The root directory will be called (VIRGO_ROOT)

2. Copy the event herald jars into VIRGO_ROOT/repository/usr

cd VIRGO_ROOT/repository/usr
unzip eh_backend.zip

3. Start Virgo (sanity check)

dmk.sh start

4. In Status.net allow OAuth connections.
a. Login to Status.net as "eventherald"
b. Click on "Settings" menu item
c. Click on "Connections" menu item
d. Click on "register an OAuth client" application (on right hand side)

g. Allow read and write access. Tick "Allow read and write".

5. Click "Save"

6. Copy the customer key, secret and base URL to the eventherald.properties file
    
statusnet.consumerKey=9517fd0bf8faa655xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
statusnet.consumerSecret=038b21e13d5xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
statusnet.baseUrl=http://localhost/statusnet/index.php/api/
